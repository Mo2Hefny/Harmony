# 🎵 Audio Classification with Machine Learning in C++ 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based audio classification system built in **C++**. It processes audio signals, extracts features, and classifies them into predefined categories using machine learning techniques. The system is optimized for performance and real-time processing, making it suitable for applications like speech recognition, music genre classification, and environmental sound analysis.

## ✨ Features
- 🎙️ **Audio Processing**: Converts raw audio data into feature-rich representations.
- 📊 **Feature Extraction**: Uses techniques like **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**, Spectrogram, and Chroma features.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**: Implements models such as **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Random Forests**, or **Neural Networks**.
- ⚡ **Optimized for Speed**: Uses efficient C++ libraries for real-time classification.
- 🛠️ **Customizable**: Easily configurable for different datasets and classification tasks.

## 🛠️ Dependencies
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
- **OpenCV** (for image-based features like spectrograms)
- **Librosa** (Python for dataset preparation, optional)
- **Eigen** (for matrix operations)
- **FFTW** (Fast Fourier Transform for signal processing)
- **Boost** (for additional utilities)

Install dependencies via:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev libfftw3-dev libboost-all-dev
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AudioClassifier.git
   cd AudioClassifier
   ```
2. **Compile the project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   ./audio_classifier path/to/audio_file.wav
   ```

## 📊 How It Works
1. **Preprocessing**: Converts audio into frequency-domain representation (e.g., MFCCs).
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts key features relevant for classification.
3. **Model Prediction**: Runs the extracted features through an ML model to determine the class.
4. **Result Output**: Displays the predicted class label.

## 🎯 Use Cases
- 🎤 **Speech Recognition**: Classify spoken words or phrases.
- 🎶 **Music Genre Classification**: Identify different music styles.
- 🌍 **Environmental Sound Recognition**: Detect sounds like sirens, birds, or machinery.
